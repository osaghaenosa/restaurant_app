# restaurant_app
This is a restaurant app for booking of food and having fun. It was designed based on a concept and it was made with
React, TypeScript.
since it is just a test version for now, there is no backend implementation, all CURD methods being used here are being stored in the local storage and it was a great experience working on this project.
